The term ‘metacomposite’ had been defined primarily in electromagnetics as a metamaterial piece characterized by double-negative electromagnetic features, i.e., a negative permittivity and negative permeability. However, recent studies show that various researchers use the term metacomposite for mechanical metamaterials which are composites and meta-sandwich structures.
