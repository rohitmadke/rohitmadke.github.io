excerpt: 'A Multiscale analysis of a triaxially braided composite has been done using semi analytical MT homogenization theory and finite element analysis. The effective properties obtained at microscale has been applied to a full scale ultra-lightweight antenna reflector and simulated under realistic thermal loadings.'
