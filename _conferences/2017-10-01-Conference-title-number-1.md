excerpt: 'In this paper, we developed a systematic numerical scheme to predict the elastic properties of textile composites. Initially, the representative volume element (RVE) models of carbon fabric composite with different architecture were modelled using TexGen. Secondly, finite element simulations of the developed models have been performed in ABAQUS^{TM} under quasi-static loading and periodic boundary conditions.'
