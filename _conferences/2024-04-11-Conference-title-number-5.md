excerpt: 'This study formulates a rigorous framework for comparing finite-element model fidelities for bolted joints in fiber-metal laminates, quantifying how successive enhancements in geometric detail, interlaminar interaction modeling, material failure laws, and mesh strategies trade off between predictive accuracy and computational cost to guide the selection of an appropriate analysis level for design and future multi-fidelity tools.'
