title: "Ph.D. Thesis Work"
excerpt: "This research proposes an innovative braided metacomposite design for ballistic applications integrating semi-auxetic braided composite with auxetic and negative stiffness (NS) mechanical metamaterials. The novelty lies in the proposed lightweight
metacomposite with dual negative metamaterials and its capability for a coupled effect to mitigate ballistice impact loads and their shocks simultaneously useful in NIJ level IV protective body armor applications <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
