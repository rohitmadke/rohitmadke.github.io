I am Rohit Raju Madke, currently senior researcher at the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India. The focus is on designing a heat-resistant meta-sandwich structure for an ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) funded project utilizing auxetic graphite cores and carbon-carbon semi-auxetic textile composite. Simulations on fracture crack initiation and propagation, including fatigue introspections, are executed with the multiscale finite element (FE) analysis and XFEM using ABAQUS™ and the phase-field method using COMSOL® Multiphysics.

My Ph.D. thesis proposed two configurations of braided metacomposite, in the form of meta-sandwich structures having outer layers comprising of braided composite and two types of core, one with 3D auxetic metamaterial and the second with dual-negative (auxetic and negative stiffness) metamaterial. The first configuration helps withstand impact with low and intermediate velocities up to 200 m/s, like a bird strike or foreign object strike. The second metacomposite system helps mitigate the body armor plate's simultaneous ballistic impact (800 m/s) and shock loads. The topological arrangement of arrays of continuous fiber inside the matrix impregnated tows or yarns and internal configurations of the woven and braided fabric and the local weave architecture distribution were controlled to design auxeticity in braided composite with the help of python-based codes and open source package TexGen. The anisotropic non-linear behavior of braided textile composite has been predicted using semi-analytical Mori-Tanaka asymptotic homogenization, mechanics of structure genome, and multiscale finite element scheme coupled with cohesive zone model and preeminent composite failure criteria. The damage and failure at various scales under static and dynamic load were predicted using ANSYS® Mechanical, ACP, Autodyn, and LS-Dyna. In addition to Lagrangian mesh, voxel meshing and meshless SPH techniques were employed at microstructural levels that can aid the designers in simplifying analysis with complex architectures and curvatures. We have utilized additive manufacturing techniques like 3D printing using PLA, nylon, resin, and metal laser cutting.

We are also exploring investment casting techniques for fabricating microlevel periodic aluminum cellular structures using slurry-cast table salt molds, as an alternative to expensive metal 3D printing.
