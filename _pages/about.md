**Introduction**\
Welcome to the professional website of Rohit Raju Madke, experienced researcher with a Ph.D. in Civil (Structural) Engineering, specializing in applied mechanics and the finite element method, focusing on composites, auxetics and negative stiffness metamaterials. Skilled in dynamic impact analysis, fracture mechanics, and nonlinear FEA using ABAQUS, COMSOL and ANSYS Mechanical. Recently completed a postdoctoral role at San Diego State University, working on modelling of static and fatigue failure of highly non-linear composite bolted joints in aerospace composite structures. Now seeking new opportunities to apply my expertise in solving aerospace and defence challenges.

**Academic Background**\
Rohit holds a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India. His doctoral research focused on groundbreaking topics in structural mechanics and materials engineering, particularly composite materials. Rohit's Ph.D. thesis proposed innovative configurations of braided metacomposites, incorporating 3D auxetic metamaterials and dual-negative metamaterials (auxetic and negative stiffness). His research utilized advanced simulation tools such as ANSYS® Mechanical, ACP, Autodyn, and LS-Dyna to predict the dynamic behavior of these metacomposites. He also used various meshing techniques and additive manufacturing methods, including 3D printing and investment casting, to fabricate micro-level periodic aluminum cellular structures.

**Professional Experience**\
Following his Ph.D., Rohit worked as a Senior Research Fellow at the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. During this tenure, he focused on designing heat-resistant meta-sandwich structures for an ISRO-funded project. This work involved the use of graphite auxetic metamaterials and carbon-carbon semi-auxetic textile composites. Rohit executed simulations on fracture, crack initiation, and propagation, including fatigue introspections, using multiscale finite element analysis and XFEM in ABAQUS™, as well as phase-field methods in COMSOL® Multiphysics and FEniCS.

At San Diego State University, Rohit has been an integral part of the Aerospace Composite Structural Mechanics Lab. His work here includes multiscale and multi-fidelity modeling and analyzing composite bolted joints in fiber metal laminates (FML). Collaborating with industry partners, he has investigated the continuum damage-based static and fatigue behavior of CFRP composites and integrated the kinetic theory of fracture-based fatigue methods into FML analysis. Rohit has also developed Python scripts and user material subroutines (UMAT/VUMAT) for constitutive material models in ABAQUS™.
